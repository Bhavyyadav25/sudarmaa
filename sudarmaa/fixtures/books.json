Kahn has adapted the scholarly English of Francis Woodman Cleaves' erudite translation in colloquial English, making this exciting narrative accessible to all readers. It is written \"as an act of research and imagination,\" an example of story-telling as history which offers not only an accurate and dramatic description of Mongolian culture and heritage, but wisdom and insight into the humanity of this small group that ruled much of Asia, Russia, and the Middle East for nearly two hundred years.\r\nAlthough it opens in a mythical past, The Secret History of the Mongols quickly becomes a treasure-trove of factual information, not only about the life and career of Chingis Khan, but also about the Mongolian people. It describes in fascinating detail the daily life, social structures, and customs of the tribes of Central Asia, and in terms of accuracy and immediacy eclipses the more familiar Travels of Marco Polo. An overview of medieval Asia, maps, lineage charts, a glossary of proper names, and a bibliography are included. This expanded edition includes a Seventeenth century account of Chingis Khan's death and a recent essay by the author.", "creator": 1, "title": "Mongolian Secret History", "rating_score": 13, "rating_votes": 3, "icon": "book_icons/Mongolwww.png"}}, {"pk": 2, "model": "books.book", "fields": {"category": 1, "description": "The anchor of The O'Reilly Factor recounts one of the most dramatic stories in American history\u2014how one gunshot changed the country forever. In the spring of 1865, the bloody saga of America's Civil War finally comes to an end after a series of increasingly harrowing battles. President Abraham Lincoln's generous terms for Robert E. Lee's surrender are devised to fulfill Lincoln's dream of healing a divided nation, with the former Confederates allowed to reintegrate into American society. But one man and his band of murderous accomplices, perhaps reaching into the highest ranks of the U.S. government, are not appeased.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the patriotic celebrations in Washington D.C., John Wilkes Booth\u2014charismatic ladies' man and impenitent racist\u2014murders Abraham Lincoln at Ford's Theatre. A furious manhunt ensues and Booth immediately becomes the country's most wanted fugitive. Lafayette C. Baker, a smart but shifty New York detective and former Union spy, unravels the string of clues leading to Booth, while federal forces track his accomplices. The thrilling chase ends in a fiery shootout and a series of court-ordered executions\u2014including that of the first woman ever executed by the U.S. government, Mary Surratt.

Yet much of what we know about Mary Boleyn has been fostered through garbled gossip, romantic fiction, and the misconceptions repeated by historians. Now, in her latest book, New York Times bestselling author and noted British historian Alison Weir gives us the first ever full-scale, in-depth biography of Henry VIII\u2019s famous mistress, in which Weir explodes much of the mythology that surrounds Mary Boleyn and uncovers the truth about one of the most misunderstood figures of the Tudor age.  \r\n \r\nWith the same brand of extensive forensic research she brought to her acclaimed book The Lady in the Tower, Weir facilitates here a new portrayal of her subjects, revealing how Mary was treated by her ambitious family and the likely nature of the relationship between the Boleyn sisters. She also posits new evidence regarding the reputation of Mary\u2019s mother, Elizabeth Howard, who was rumored to have been an early mistress of Henry VIII.\r\n \r\nWeir unravels the truth about Mary\u2019s much-vaunted notoriety at the French court and her relations with King Fran\u00e7ois I. She offers plausible theories as to what happened to Mary during the undocumented years of her life, and shows that, far from marrying an insignificant and complacent nonentity, she made a brilliant match with a young man who was the King\u2019s cousin and a rising star at court. \r\n \r\nWeir also explores Mary\u2019s own position and role at the English court, and how she became Henry VIII\u2019s mistress. She tracks the probable course of their affair and investigates Mary\u2019s real reputation. With new and compelling evidence, Weir presents the most conclusive answer to date on the paternity of Mary\u2019s children, long speculated to have been Henry VIII\u2019s progeny.\r\n \r\nAlison Weir has drawn fascinating information from the original sources of the period to piece together a life steeped in mystery and misfortune, debunking centuries-old myths and disproving accepted assertions, to give us the truth about Mary Boleyn, the so-called great and infamous whore.", "creator": 1, "title": "Mary Boleyn: The Mistress of Kings", "rating_score": 9, "rating_votes": 2, "icon": "book_icons/519rUKqQ-L._SL120_.jpg"}}, {"pk": 4, "model": "books.book", "fields": {"category": 1, "description": "The Mongol army led by Genghis Khan subjugated more lands and people in twenty-?ve years than the Romans did in four hundred.
